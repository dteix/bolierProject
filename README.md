1. <!doctype html> : a doctype declaration which tells the browser that the document is using HTML

2. html class="no-js" lang="" : the "no-js" class gets removed by a Javascript library (Modernizr), 
   and this gets replaced with a js class. When Modernizr loads, it replaces no-js with js 
   
   This is a way to style with OR without Javascript. 
   
   In other words, CSS styles can be defined for JavaScript-enabled browsers and for browsers that 
   have JavaScript disabled. lang="" sets the language of the web page
